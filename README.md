# Korify

Under 🚧 🛠️

- This is me trying to explore C, the concept of pointers, and the like. The encryption "algorithm" is not good (it's actually bad) and needs a lot of work.

## Usage
```sh
./kori -ef sample.txt
```

## Commands
- `-ef`👉 short for encrypt file
   - ./kori -ef "the path to file"
   - ./kori -ef sample.txt  -> get the sample.txt on the current directory
